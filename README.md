Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network
This project implements a neural network model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from sklearn's datasets.

Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:

Load the Breast Cancer dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Preprocess the data by standardizing the features.
Build a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Train and evaluate the model.
Visualize the training history.
Make predictions on new data.
Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is used in this project. It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Features: 30 numeric features (mean, standard error, and worst/largest value for each of 10 different characteristics of the cell nuclei).
Target: Binary classification (0: Malignant, 1: Benign).
